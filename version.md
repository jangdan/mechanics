###β
######β0.7.1 (1.14.15)
* enabled gravity mode (temporarily)

######β0.7.0 (1.13.15)
* the program is now officially useful (as far as I can think, it could have been useful before)
	* because you can view some of the properties of a block!
	* more coming!
* many bug fixes and code cleanup.
* and more.

######β0.6.6 (1.12.15)
* fixed an annoying pause/play bug.

######β0.6.5 (1.11.15)
* Split the graphics loop and the animation loop for efficiency and speed
* Themes now also store acceleration arrow color data (other colors will be supported, coming in the near future)

######β0.6.4 (1.9.15)
* Added THEME support
* pressing shift while adding a force will add perpendicular forces -even while running the simulation
	
######β0.6.3 (1.8.15)
* Fixed a SILLY mistake that happened because I didn’t know physics properly. (about acceleration)
* Rewrote the inefficient graphics loop code (but in turn added a new class)
* made the block smaller
* Removed the ‘physics concepts’ pane.
